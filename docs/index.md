* Have you faced some issues when managing the members in your restaurant? `ezFoodie` is here!

* `ezFoodie` is a desktop application for managing members in a restaurant, optimized for using via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, ezFoodie can get your member management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

* If you are interested in using `ezFoodie`, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-f12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).

* If you are interested in developing `ezFoodie`, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-f12-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
