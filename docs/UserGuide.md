## Introduction

Welcome to ezFoodie’s User Guide! 🤩

Have you faced issues when managing the members of your restaurant? ezFoodie is here!

ezFoodie is a desktop application that helps restaurants **keep track of their ever-growing list of members**. Restaurant managers and staffs can easily view and update member status (e.g. personal information, tier, reservation, transaction, etc.) to manage and analyze members.

ezFoodie is simple and user-friendly. It is optimized for using via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still enjoying the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ezFoodie can get your member management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

Continue reading to explore the wonders of ezFoodie and enhance the way you manage and analyze your restaurant's members 🤩

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find -mem -n <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `find -mem -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `list -mem [-pg <PAGE>]` can be used as `list -mem -pg 1` or as `list -mem`.

* The `list` and `find` only show top 50 records by default. Pagination can be used `[-pg <PAGE>]` as optional value to choose different pages.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  **e.g.** if you specify `-p 12341234 -p 56785678`, only `-p 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  **e.g.** if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Meanings of shortcuts:

    * `-id/`: member ID or transaction ID

    * `-i/`: index number of the member list

    * `-mem/`: member

    * `-n/`: name
